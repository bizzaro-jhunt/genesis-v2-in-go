The Great Laptop Move Cleanup of 2018

Dearest Ilya,

Today I uncovered the fevered dreams of a man mad with _the Go_.
Having succumbed to the peer pressures of rewriting the whole
world in the newest, hotness-est language, I embarked on a futile
quest to implement what was meant to be a Perl script in as
unforgiving and incapable a language as Go.

Luckily, for the sake of all mankind, I failed.

These are what is left of those mad ramblings.  Please guard them
delicately, and do not let them out to the wild.
